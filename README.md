yuki.cfg
========
high-fps competitive csgo config

yuki.cfg contains commands
userconfig.cfg contains binds

some commands are useless without the binds and viceversa, and some binds need to be changed in both yuki.cfg and userconfig.cfg if you are going to change them.

everything should be easily modifiable as it is well organized. "preference_commands" and "crosshair_commands" are likely what you would be most interested in checking out, together with binds of course.

Installation
============
put launch commands into launchcommands, if you do not how to do this, ignore it.

put the files here;

Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg

when using config for first time be sure to write "exec yuki" in console. viewmodel settings might reset occasionally, fix this by execing yuki in console again (just write "ae" in console to refresh settings)

quickrcon.cfg, lollollol.cfg and quick.cfg are not needed, add them if you feel they'll be of use to you.

quick.cfg = training config

quickrcon.cfg = rcon version of quick (for non-local servers)

lollollol.cfg = become the MLG pro you always knew you were

Extras (Text Update)
============
This will update your text in game, mostly it makes things more easy to read, increases size and what not. This textfile contains some internal jokes in my friendgroup as well as modifying some text to be Swedish. I don't recommend using it unless you speak Swedish.

Put csgo_yuki.txt in your resource folder:
Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\resource

Add "-language yuki" to your launch options.

Usage
============
Press "F2" to see all non-default binds listed in console.

Helpful Info
============
This config supports multiple viewmodel settings and multiple crosshairs. If you use crosshair or viewmodel to line up grenades you can edit the toggles to have both your normal crosshair+viewmodel as well as a viewmodel/crosshair you use to line up your grenades.

The crosshair supports different color for different crosshairs without breaking the nadecolor-binds.
